                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>During a stroll in their childhood neighbourhood, siblings Benjamin and Isabelle Johnston spotted a
                    large retail space for lease in the epicentre of Riley Park, and they knew what they wanted to do.
                    They envisioned a space between the pretentious bars and the young nightclubs for the neighbourhood
                    to enjoy a whole new brewing experience, and thus, Live Kombucha Brewing Co. was made.</p>

                <p>It was the perfect balance that Riley Park needed. The once sleepy neighbourhood became more lively
                    as more retailers and restaurants moved in as a result of the brewery's success.

                <h3>Why Choose Us?</h3>
                <p>All of our ingredients are locally sourced. We work with local farmers to provide the freshest fruits
                    with the highest quality. We are in frequent contact with our farmers to provide products that are
                    in season with the farming schedules. Therefore, some of our products are not always available and
                    most of them are seasonal.
                </p>

                <p>We make sure our farmers are getting living wages and are treated with respect during their
                    workplace. The farms we work with also work with major local restaurants in the city as well,
                    promoting less travel time for goods between the city and the farms.
                </p>

                <p>Our farm-to-table system allows for the freshest products to be sold to our customers. Which is why
                    we limit our kombucha brand to only Vancouver, Montreal and Toronto as we have been motivated to
                    work with farmers nationwide. Before we provide our products in each metro area, we make sure that
                    we have worked with the right suppliers, local restaurant and grocery chains and local farmers to
                    provide the same quality of product that we have here at home in Riley Park.
                </p>

                <p>We make sure that our packaging is reusable and easy to recycle. In Vancouver, customers are able to
                    bring back their empty bottles for their $1 recycling fee back and a 10% off their next purchase
                    in-store. In other metro areas, customers are able to bring empty containers to their local
                    recycling depot to receive their $1 bottle refund.
                </p>

                <p>We love working with all types of businesses to promote communities in every neighbourhood we reach
                    in the metro areas that we serve.</p>

                <p>Our company was created based on local entrepreneurship, fresh ingredients, and sustainability. Along
                    with that we strive to provide customers with great products that all will love at a low and
                    welcoming price point.</p>
