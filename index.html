                <h3>Ginger Lime Kombucha</h3>
                <p>This is our best selling flavour batch to date, the spice from the ginger conteracts the
                    tartness of the lime to create the perfect harmony of flavours. We have paired these two flavours
                    with a subtle, but powerful black tea.
                </p>

                <p>All of our ingredients are locally sourced. We work with local farmers to provide the freshest fruits
                    with the highest quality. We are in frequent contact with our farmers to provide products that are
                    in season with the farming schedules. Therefore, some of our products are not always available and
                    most of them are seasonal.
                </p>

                <p><em>Made with all natural ingredients. Brewed using high quality tea from our friends at
                        Great Wall Tea in New Westminister.</em> Ⓥ</p>

                <h3>5 Year Anniversary</h3>
                <p> We have been in business for 5 years! We want your help to celebrate!</p>
                <p>It was 5 whole years ago that we decided to put all of our faith in a single space in Riley Park,
                    and thanks to our loyal customers, those 5 years have really paid off. We went into the project not
                    really sure what to expect, but are overwhelmed with the outcome.

                    We cannot emphasize enough that the success of our company could not have been possible without your
                    support, so we want your help to celebrate! Join us on May 3rd at our Riley Park location for a
                    night of kombucha, community and fun. We have also partnered with local vegan food hub Chickpea who
                    are going to supply snacks for the night.
